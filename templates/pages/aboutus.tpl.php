            <h2>Foundation</h2>
            <p>The start of our foundation was encouraged by a cross-border and unshakable co-operation, which was represented by our Facebook group members.
            The CsodaCsoport Foundation is one of the few civil organisations, which are based on a co-operation from a social media platform.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to help with the healing of children suffering from illness or other health diseases, and to prevent any further deterioration of their prognosis, via providing financial support for the necessary medical treatments.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to make are activities known in a broader circle, and to involve a wide variaty of people into social responsibility and community donations.</p>
            <p>The group tries to take advantage of the possibilities provided the social media paltforms, in order to make donation an everyday practice. 
            On the other hand it plays as a role of pioneer to elevate donation to the level of society.</p>
